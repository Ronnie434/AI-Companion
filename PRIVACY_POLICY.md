## 3. How We Use Your Information

### Website (Waitlist)

We use your waitlist information to:

- Add you to our launch notification list
- Send you updates about Asteron availability
- Conduct user research to improve our product
- Analyze signup patterns to better understand our audience

### Mobile App

Since all app data is stored locally on your device, we do not use or access your personal task information. The app uses your data solely to:

- Display and manage your tasks, reminders, and items
- Send local push notifications for reminders you've set
- Provide the core functionality of the application

## 4. Data Storage and Security

### Website Data

Waitlist information collected through our website is stored securely using:

- **Google Sheets** — Your waitlist submission data is stored in Google Sheets via the Google Sheets API
- **Vercel** — Our website is hosted on Vercel's secure infrastructure

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information, including secure API connections and access controls.

### Mobile App Data

Your mobile app data is stored **exclusively on your device** using:

- **SQLite Database** — A local database stored on your iOS or Android device
- **Local Storage** — All data remains on your device and is not transmitted to external servers

Your data security on the mobile app depends on your device's security settings, including passcode, biometric authentication, and device encryption. We recommend keeping your device's operating system updated and using strong device security measures.

## 5. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

**Future Services:** We may integrate a backend AI API for text parsing in future versions. This policy will be updated before any such integration to describe how that data will be handled.

Please note that these third-party services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them:
