# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** December 2025

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using Asteron services, including our website (ai-companion-web) and mobile application (ai-companion-app), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use our services.

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Asteron ("we," "us," or "our"). We may update these Terms from time to time as described in Section 15.

Your continued use of our services after any changes to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes.

## 2. Description of Services

Asteron provides productivity and task management services through two platforms:

### 2.1 Asteron Website

Our website (ai-companion-web) is a marketing landing page that provides:

- Information about the Asteron mobile application
- Feature descriptions and product showcase
- Waitlist signup with optional survey questions
- Dark and light theme viewing options

The website does not require user accounts or authentication.

### 2.2 Asteron Mobile App

Our mobile application (ai-companion-app) is available for iOS and Android devices and provides:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Capture | Text input for recording thoughts, tasks, and reminders |
| Voice Input | Voice capture interface (future feature) |
| Confirm Screen | Review and edit AI-parsed items before saving |
| Daily Brief | Summary view of today's tasks and reminders |
| Upcoming | View of future tasks organized by date |
| Settings | Theme preferences, quiet hours, and data management |
| Notifications | Local push notifications for reminders |
| Delete All Data | Permanent data deletion option |

**Important:** The mobile app uses a **local-first architecture**. All your data is stored exclusively on your device using SQLite. We do not have access to your data, and there is no cloud synchronization.

## 3. Eligibility

To use Asteron services, you must:

- Be at least **13 years of age**
- Have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms
- Not be prohibited from using the services under applicable law

If you are between 13 and 18 years of age, we recommend that a parent or guardian review these Terms with you. By using our services, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements.

We do not knowingly collect information from or provide services to children under 13. If we discover that a user is under 13, we will take appropriate steps as described in our Privacy Policy.

## 4. User Accounts

### 4.1 No Account Required

Asteron operates without user accounts. This means:

- **No registration** — You do not need to create an account to use the mobile app
- **No passwords** — There are no credentials to remember or recover
- **No login** — Simply download and start using the app

### 4.2 Local-Only Data Storage

All your data is stored locally on your device. As a result:

- **No password recovery** — Since there are no accounts, there is no password to reset
- **No remote access** — We cannot access, recover, or restore your data
- **Device-dependent** — Your data exists only on the device where you created it

### 4.3 Waitlist Signup

The waitlist signup on our website requires only an email address and survey responses. This is not an account—it is simply a way to join our notification list for product updates.

## 5. User Responsibilities

By using Asteron, you agree to the following responsibilities:

### 5.1 Device Security

Since your data is stored locally on your device, you are responsible for:

- Keeping your device secure with a passcode, PIN, or biometric authentication
- Maintaining your device's operating system with security updates
- Protecting physical access to your device
- Understanding that anyone with access to your unlocked device may access your Asteron data

### 5.2 Data Backup

Our local-first architecture means:

- **You are responsible for backing up your device** using your device manufacturer's backup features (e.g., iCloud, Google Backup)
- **We cannot recover lost data** if your device is lost, stolen, damaged, or reset
- **No cloud sync** — Your data is not automatically backed up to our servers
- **Data loss is permanent** without your own backup measures

### 5.3 Accurate Information

You agree to:

- Review AI-parsed items before saving them
- Verify that task details, dates, and reminders are accurate
- Not rely solely on AI parsing for critical information

### 5.4 Appropriate Use

## 6. User Content

### 6.3 User Responsibility for Content

You are solely responsible for:

Since your content never leaves your device, we have no ability to monitor, review, or moderate it.

## 7. AI Features and Limitations

Asteron includes AI-powered text parsing features that attempt to:

- Extract task titles from your input

- Critical information should be verified manually
- AI may misinterpret dates, times, or intent

### 7.3 Confidence Scores

The app displays confidence scores for AI-parsed items. These scores indicate:

- **High confidence** — The AI is relatively certain about the parsing

**You are responsible for verifying AI-parsed information regardless of confidence level.**
